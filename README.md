# Cardinality Constrained Optimisation

The goal of this optimisation is to find a subset portfolio of N stocks from a universe of M stocks that maximises the Sharpe Ratio. 

The optimisation is constrained by the maximum number of stocks that can be held (i.e. N). 

The portfolio weightings is constrained to 1 (i.e. no leverage or cash).

Each stock allocation (weighting) is constrained to be between 0 and 1. (i.e. no shorting).

Lastly, if the user wants, he/she should be able to specify a minimum expected return. He/she should also be able to run the optimisation constrained by a maximum level of risk.

## Why Cardinality Constrained?

I want to constrain the number of stocks that can be held in the portfolio so that transaction costs and the effort to rebalance the portfolio is manageable. The other reason for this is that the optimisation relys on a variance-covariance matrix that needs at least T = N time series obseravtions else the variance-covariance matrix cannot be invertible. 

So, for a universe of 500 stocks, I would need at least 500 (2 years worth of ) observations to be able to acturately estimate the variance-covariance matrix. This poses a challenge when trying to pick an optimal portfolio from a universe of 500+ stocks. 

In terms of ETFs, I have a set of around 1700 that I would like to pick from. So constraining the portfolio to a maximum number of ETFs is a necessary constraint.

## Implcit Assumptions

When running a mean-variance optimisation, it is assumed implicitly that the variance-covariance structure of the portfolio will remain constant. The same goes for the expected returns. 

Another assumption is that historical average returns and sample variances and covariances are good estimators for the true (and assumed constant) average returns and variances and covariances. This is a faulty assumption because all three variables change over time. 

# Objective Function

The objective function is defined as: 

obj = E(R)/Std(R)

where E(R) is the stock's expected return and Std(R) is the standard deviation of the returns.

## Alternative Objective Function

An alternative is to use a tail risk objective function. For example conditional value at risk (CVaR) or conditional expected shortfall (CES). Although, these functions would likely need to be estimated using numerical estimations. 

# Plan

I want to be able to solve the cardinality constrained problem quickly, so an approximate solution like evolutionalry (done) or particle swarm algorithms could be used. An alternative would be to use mixed integer programming to solve the problem, but I have not been able to work out how to do that yet. 

First, I am going to try create a genetic algorithm (done), and then I will try something else. Maybe I will constrain the problem to take a limited amount of time too... we will see.
